<ul>
    <li>I like to hike and rock-climb, but I'm not <em>that</em> serious about them, so you might be better than I am</li>
    <li>I used to work for a distillery, so I know a lot about whisky (and have a lot of their t-shirts, clearly)</li>
    <li>I watch a lot of Great British Bakeoff and do a little bit of baking myself (my biscuit recipe lives <a href="https://blog.charlietrochlil.com/biscuits">here</a>)</li>
    <li>I write songs and poems. You can watch a music video I made with a friend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrOW4FFnXpY&ab_channel=rhymeswithvocal">here</a></li>

<h2><span class="blonk">FAQs</span></h2>
    
<h3 class="fa">Why go to all the work of making this site when dating apps exist?</h3>
    <p class="q">One of the things I hold most dearly is my commitment to stupid bits, and this is a pretty good stupid bit, so we're going for maximum effort. The outcomes aren't the point; the bit is.</p>
<h3 class="fa">So this is a joke?</h3>
    <p class="q">Mostly, but I really am single ;)</p>
<h3 class="fa">Do you think you're funny?</h3>
    <p class="q">Yea, I guess. More to the point, I recognize that this isn't up everybody's alley, but if you've read all the way to the bottom of the page you must be at least <em>intrigued</em> by this silly joke. I think there's some value in that. </p>
